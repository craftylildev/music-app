# Music App

This was the project I worked on throughout the entire front end course at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/). When I learned a new technique, library or language, I implemented it on this project. This is the refactored version, rebuilt with Angular. You can view the original project history [here](https://github.com/craftylildev/musichistory-boilerplate).
